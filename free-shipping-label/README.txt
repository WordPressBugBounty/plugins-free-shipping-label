== Description ==

With our progress bar notification, you can give your customers a clear picture of just how close they are to qualifying for free shipping. This not only stops shoppers from leaving, but also encourages them to add more items to their cart and increase their order value - boosting your revenue in the process. 

Now, introducing the exciting Gift Bar module, adding a touch of delight to the shopping journey. Motivate your customers to go the extra mile, qualifying for a free gift. This strategic move not only enhances order values but adds an element of excitement to the entire purchasing process.

Not only that, but our progress bar notification also provides a sense of urgency for your customers to reach the free shipping threshold. This can drive impulse purchases and increase the likelihood of your customers completing their purchase. By keeping the progress bar front and center, your customers will always be aware of how close they are to qualifying for free shipping, making them more likely to add that one extra item to reach the threshold.

Additionally, our progress bar notification is fully customizable to fit the look and feel of your brand. You can choose from a range of colors and styles to match your website's aesthetic, ensuring a seamless integration with your existing design.

4. Set up the plugin and when you're ready, enable it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I need to do for the Free Shipping Label plugin to work properly? =

In order for the Free Shipping Label plugin to work properly, you will need to set up WooCommerce zones and shipping methods. Additionally, the progress bar will only be displayed on the cart and checkout pages for zones that have defined free shipping methods. You can find more information about this in the [official documentation](https://devnet.hr/docs/free-shipping-label/woocommerce-settings/).

= Mini cart not showing progress bar =

Some themes and plugins may have their own minicart templates that override or exclude the default WooCommerce hook where the progress bar should be displayed. In this case, our pro version offers a shortcode that can be placed anywhere on the site, including the minicart. Alternatively, a more advanced option is to modify the minicart template and add the `woocommerce_widget_shopping_cart_before_buttons` hook to ensure the progress bar is displayed correctly.

= What should I do if the Progress Bar is not showing? =

First, check if you have enabled the Progress Bar switch in the settings. If it's already enabled, go through the [WooCommerce setup guide](https://devnet.hr/docs/free-shipping-label/woocommerce-settings/) and ensure everything is configured correctly. If you are still experiencing problems, contact the support team.

= What if I'm using other shipping-related plugins? =

If you are using any other plugins for shipping or free shipping functionalities, it may be the case that the plugin you have installed is not compatible with the Free Shipping Label plugin. You can enable the Custom threshold option in the General settings and manually set your Free Shipping minimum amount. If this doesn't work, contact the support team.

= What if I suspect a template issue? =

If you have followed all steps above and still progress bar won’t show, then this might be a template issue. If the progress bar is showing for example on the checkout page but not on the cart page, or vice versa, then it's probably a template issue. In this case, our pro version offers a shortcode that can be placed anywhere on the site, or you can edit the WooCommerce templates, but this requires a little bit of PHP, HTML and CSS knowledge. Be careful as you'll have to figure out on your own what to do.

= What are the WooCommerce hooks that are used for displaying the Progress Bar? =

The WooCommerce hooks that are used for displaying the Progress Bar are as follows:

Cart page hook: `woocommerce_proceed_to_checkout`
Mini-cart widget hook: `woocommerce_widget_shopping_cart_before_buttons`
Checkout hook: `woocommerce_review_order_before_submit`
